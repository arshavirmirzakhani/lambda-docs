Installation first go to https://github.com/arshavirmirzakhani/lambda and download latest version lambda from releases tab First look when you open lambda you should see somthing like this : on left you see the nodes tab , you can create nodes by clicking the buttons on right you see the editor , this is where you use nodes Basic concept lets create our first flow that gets two number as input and adds them then shows the result to do that first click on \"Constant\" button to create a Constant node now you should see the constant node on editor in lambda each node represent an operation. nodes can be connected to each other from ports using links , for example you can connect a constant node to an label node like the image below : when an node output port connect to another node input port , the value of input will be set to value of the output. Make your first basic flow now lets make a flow that adds two number and show the result here are the steps with explanation : create two constant node constant node are used to output numerical values create an add node this node is used two add two values connect one constant node to first pin and connect another one to second pin now we created a flow that adds two number now lets output the value create an label node and connect it to output of the add node label node id used to see output of nodes now you should see somthing like this : shortcuts here some short cuts in lambda : C copy nodes V paste nodes Del delete nodes/links","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"in this page you will learn how to use lambda!","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting_started/#installation","text":"first go to https://github.com/arshavirmirzakhani/lambda and download latest version lambda from releases tab","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting_started/#first-look","text":"when you open lambda you should see somthing like this : on left you see the nodes tab , you can create nodes by clicking the buttons on right you see the editor , this is where you use nodes","title":"First look"},{"location":"getting_started/#basic-concept","text":"lets create our first flow that gets two number as input and adds them then shows the result to do that first click on \"Constant\" button to create a Constant node now you should see the constant node on editor in lambda each node represent an operation. nodes can be connected to each other from ports using links , for example you can connect a constant node to an label node like the image below : when an node output port connect to another node input port , the value of input will be set to value of the output.","title":"Basic concept"},{"location":"getting_started/#make-your-first-basic-flow","text":"now lets make a flow that adds two number and show the result here are the steps with explanation :","title":"Make your first basic flow"},{"location":"getting_started/#create-two-constant-node","text":"constant node are used to output numerical values","title":"create two constant node"},{"location":"getting_started/#create-an-add-node","text":"this node is used two add two values","title":"create an add node"},{"location":"getting_started/#connect-one-constant-node-to-first-pin-and-connect-another-one-to-second-pin","text":"now we created a flow that adds two number now lets output the value","title":"connect one constant node to first pin and connect another one to second pin"},{"location":"getting_started/#create-an-label-node-and-connect-it-to-output-of-the-add-node","text":"label node id used to see output of nodes now you should see somthing like this :","title":"create an label node and connect it to output of the add node"},{"location":"getting_started/#shortcuts","text":"here some short cuts in lambda : C copy nodes V paste nodes Del delete nodes/links","title":"shortcuts"}]}
